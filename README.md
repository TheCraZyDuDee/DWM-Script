# DWM-Script
Standalone Script from my [Gaming Optimization](https://github.com/crustySenpai/Windows-Gaming-Optimization-Script) to enable/disable dwm<br/>
**ONLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS 10**

Currently there is a Batch and a Powershell Variant:

dwm script.bat is just a quick standalone batch script from my [Gaming Optimization](https://github.com/crustySenpai/Windows-Gaming-Optimization-Script)

dwm script test.ps1 is basically the same just rewritten into a powershell script thanks to the help of OpenAI's GPT-3 however it's way more userfriendly since it has an own GUI aswell as logging for better troubleshooting and more
