# DWM-Script
Standalone Script from my [Gaming Optimization](https://github.com/crustySenpai/Windows-Gaming-Optimization-Script) to enable/disable dwm<br/>
**ONLY SUPPORTS WINDOWS 10**

There are now 2 Versions available:<br/>
dwm script.bat is just a quick standalone batch script from my [Gaming Optimization](https://github.com/crustySenpai/Windows-Gaming-Optimization-Script)<br/>
dwm script test.ps1 is basically the same just rewritten into a powershell script thanks to the help of OpenAI's GPT-3 however it's way more userfriendly since it has an own GUI aswell as logging for better troubleshooting and more

For some context i just used chatgpt out of curiosity and to mess arround with it however it fascinated me so much that i just decited to make a whole script port with it since i wanted to learn about powershell anyway eventually.
